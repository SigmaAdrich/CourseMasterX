## **Program Operation**

1. **Start the Program**  
   Double-click `CourseMasterX.exe` to run with default settings and check if the program starts successfully.

2. **Set Search Range**  
   After starting, the program will prompt you to input a search range.  
   - **Recommended value**: `9` (The larger the number, the wider the search range the program will attempt).

3. **Execution Results**  
   After execution, check whether the following result files are generated:
   - `result_class_0.csv`
   - `result_room_0.csv`
   - `result_teacher_0.csv`
   - `result_unit_0.csv`

   If additional files are generated, don't worry; this indicates that the program has created multiple scheduling solutions.

## **Configuration File Description**

After successfully performing basic operations, learn how to modify configuration files to meet specific requirements.

### **Configuration File Location**
All configuration files are located in the `really_data_csv` folder. All files used by the program are in **CSV format** and can be opened and edited using **Office Excel**, **WPS Excel**, or directly with a text editor.

### **time Folder**

The `time` folder contains two time configuration files: `1.csv` and `2.csv`, which are used to define available time slots for classes. For example, in `1.csv`:

<img src="1csv.PNG" alt="Time Configuration File Screenshot" width="500">

- The table contains 7 columns, corresponding to the 7 days of the week, with 15 time slots per day.
  - **Slots marked with `1`**: Unavailable.  
  - **Slots marked with `0`**: Available.  
- Example:
  - On weekdays (Monday to Friday), the "morning" has 5 time slots marked as `0`, and the "afternoon" also has 5 time slots marked as `0`. These time slots are available for scheduling classes.

---

### **Special Case Explanation**

#### Example Question:
**If a course requires 6 consecutive lessons, can it be scheduled according to the current settings in `1.csv`?**

**Answer: No**, because no single time slot can accommodate 6 consecutive lessons.  
It is recommended to split the course into two sessions, such as "3 3" or "2 4", ensuring that each session occupies no more than 5 time slots.

---

## **Result File Description**

Result files with the same trailing number belong to the same scheduling solution. For example:  
`result_room_0.csv`, `result_teacher_0.csv`, `result_unit_0.csv`, and `result_class_0.csv` belong to the same solution set.
